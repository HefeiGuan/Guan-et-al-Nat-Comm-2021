All the analyses for data that have shown in the manuscript were done by MATLAB R2019a, MathWorks, in the operating system of Windows 10. 

Although our manuscript replied on the use of custom code, they were customized based on the publications that we referenced in our manuscript. As a result, the codes for the important analyses in the manuscript are listed below, also please find them in the same folder.

1. Firing properties of place cells were identified and calculated with ’FiringMap.m’ and ‘IsolationDistance’.

2. Sharp wave ripples was detected and properties were calculated with ‘FindRipples.m’ and ‘RippleStats.m’.

3. Cell assembly analyses were calculated with ‘CellAssembly.m’.

4. Synchronization of sharp wave ripples were calculated with ‘CondProbHist’.

5. Replay were calculated with ‘decode_calcPosterior.m’, ‘Replay_Shuffling.m’ and ‘Replay_Pvalue.m’.
